## CSV Files

[`dhs_clusters.csv`](./dhs_clusters.csv): This CSV file contains data derived from DHS surveys, aggregated to the cluster level. Each of the 19,669 rows (excluding the CSV header) represents a cluster from a single survey. The columns are as follows:

column          | description
----------------|------------
`country`       | country
`year`          | year that the survey started (some surveys lasted more than 1 year)
`lat`           | latitude coordinate of the cluster, possibly displaced (see [below](#gps-coordinate-displacement))
`lon`           | longitude coordinate of the cluster, possibly displaced (see [below](#gps-coordinate-displacement))
`wealthpooled`  | mean asset wealth index (AWI) of households within the cluster
`households`    | number of households surveyed in the cluster
`urban_rural`   | 0 = rural, 1 = urban

The AWI used in the `wealthpooled` index was computed as follows:
1. Take the PCA of household-level assets from 86 DHS surveys spanning 1994 to 2016. The value of the first principle component is the household-level asset wealth index (AWI).
    - TODO: explain which 86 DHS surveys. See `/atlas/group/poverty_data/surveys/wealthpooled/original_survey_file/AllCountryWealthIndex.csv`
    - TODO: explain how the AWI was created. See Neal Jean's poverty prediction repo.
2. Within each cluster, compute the mean household-level AWI to get the cluster-level AWI. We computed the AWI for 35,235 clusters.
3. Remove clusters from surveys started in 2008 or earlier (only keep surveys between 2009-2016, inclusive), and remove clusters whose GPS coordinates or urban/rural status were unknown. This leaves us with 19,669 clusters spanning 43 DHS surveys.


[`dhsnl_locs.csv`](./dhsnl_locs.csv): This CSV file contains locations used for training the transfer learning models. The 260,415 locations were sampled randomly from an 18x18 grid centered on each DHS survey location, where each grid cell has dimensions 0.00833Â° latitude and longitude. The original DHS cluster locations (from `dhs_clusters.csv`) are included as well. Locations for which satellite images could not be obtained were filtered out. The columns are as follows:

column    | description
----------|------------
`country` | country
`year`    | year
`lat`     | latitude coordinate
`lon`     | longitude coordinate


[`lsms_clusters.csv`](./lsms_clusters.csv): This CSV file indicates the locations and years of the LSMS clusters. Each of the 2,913 rows (excluding the CSV header) represents a cluster from a single survey. The columns are as follows:

column          | description
----------------|------------
`country`       | country
`year`          | year that the survey started (some surveys lasted more than 1 year)
`lat`           | latitude coordinate of the cluster, possibly displaced (see [below](#gps-coordinate-displacement))
`lon`           | longitude coordinate of the cluster, possibly displaced (see [below](#gps-coordinate-displacement))
`geolev1`       | administrative level-1 region name
`geolev2`       | administrative level-2 region name


[`lsms_diffs.csv`](./lsms_diffs.csv): This CSV file contains the changes in asset wealth index (AWI) over time for LSMS clusters. Each of the 1,539 rows (excluding the CSV header) represents a cluster across two surveys. The columns are as follows:

column          | description
----------------|------------
`country`       | country
`lat`           | latitude coordinate of the cluster, possibly displaced (see [below](#gps-coordinate-displacement))
`lon`           | longitude coordinate of the cluster, possibly displaced (see [below](#gps-coordinate-displacement))
`year.x`        | year that 1st survey started (some surveys lasted more than 1 year)
`year.y`        | year that 2nd survey started, `year.y` > `year.x`
`diff_of_index` | change in cluster-level AWI, see below
`index_of_diff` | cluster-level index of asset differences, see below
`households`    | number of households that were included in the calculation of the change in cluster-level AWI
`geolev1`       | administrative level-1 region name
`geolev2`       | administrative level-2 region name

For each pair of years, the `diff_of_index` value for a given cluster *C* is (cluster *C*'s AWI in year `year.y`) - (cluster *C*'s AWI in year `year.x`). Only households that were surveyed in both `year.x` and `year.y` were included in the mean. Here, the cluster-level AWI is computed in a similar fasion as for the DHS surveys, taking the PCA of the household assets and then taking the mean across households.

In contrast, the `index_of_diff` value for a given cluster is computed as follows:
1. For each household that exists across 2 surveys, compute the difference in that household's assets between the two surveys.
2. Compute the PCA of these asset-differences across the 5 countries for which we have LSMS surveys. The value of the first principle component is the household-level index of asset differences.
3. Within each cluster, compute the mean household-level index of asset differences to get the cluster-level index of asset differences.

Note that for the same cluster, the number of households used in one pair of years (`year.x`, `year.y`) might be different from the number of households in a different pairt of years. This is because even though LSMS attempts to be a panel survey, some households are not recorded at each survey. For example, a household surveyed in 2005 and 2009 rounds may have moved between 2009 and 2013. Thus, this household would be included in the cluster household count in (`year.x` = 2005, `year.y` = 2009) but not in (`year.x` = 2009, `year.y` = 2013).


## Python Pickle (`.pkl`) Files

[`dhs_incountry_folds.pkl`](./dhs_incountry_folds.pkl): This Python Pickle file is created by [`preprocessing/2_create_incountry_folds.ipynb`](../preprocessing/2_create_incountry_folds.ipynb) and contains a Python dictionary representing the "in-country" cross-validation folds for DHS clusters. See [`preprocessing/2_create_incountry_folds.ipynb`](../preprocessing/2_create_incountry_folds.ipynb) for more details.


[`lsms_incountry_folds.pkl`](./lsms_incountry_folds.pkl): Similar to `dhs_incountry_folds.pkl`, except for LSMS clusters.


## GPS coordinate displacement

In DHS surveys, all households within a single cluster are assigned the same GPS coordinates. (A *cluster* roughly corresponds to a village in rural regions and a neighborhood in urban regions.) Furthermore, DHS surveys displace the true GPS coordinates of each cluster in order to protect respondent confidentiality. According to the [DHS website](https://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/GPS-Data-Collection.cfm):

> Urban clusters contain a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 2 kilometers of error.
> Rural clusters contain a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 5 kilometers of positional error with a further 1% of the rural clusters displaced a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10 kilometers.

Recently, LSMS surveys have also adopted the same location displacement procedure. For more information, please consult the [*Geographic Displacement Procedure and Georeferenced Data Release Policy for the Demographic and Health Surveys*](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-SAR7-Spatial-Analysis-Reports.cfm).

## Other notes about the data files

The (lat, lon) coordinates in the CSV files should be read according to the IEEE 32-bit floating point standard. For example, the CSV files can be read using the Python pandas library as follows:

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('dhs_clusters.csv', float_precision='high', index_col=False)
for col in ['lat', 'lon']:
    df[col] = df[col].astype('float32')
```


## TODO

- For DHS, add district ID to each village
- Check that the links in this README work.
- For LSMS, check terminology on geolev1 / geolev2 description
- For LSMS, double-check GPS displacement policy
